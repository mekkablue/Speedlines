# Speedlines.glyphsFilter

This is a plugin for the [Glyphs font editor](http://glyphsapp.com/) by Georg Seifert.
It adds speedlines to your glyphs. After installation, it will add the menu item *Filter > Speedlines*.
You can set a keyboard shortcut in System Preferences.

### Installation

1. Go to *Window > Plugin Manager.*
2. Click on the *Install* button next to *Speedlines.*
3. Restart the app.

### Usage Instructions

1. Select a glyph in Edit view, or select any number of glyphs in Font or Edit View.
2. Choose *Filter > Speedlines*.

Alternatively, you can also use it as a custom parameter. Click on the gear menu in the lower left to copy such a parameter into the clipboard. Paste it into the custom parameters of an instance.

At the end of the parameter value, you can hang `exclude:` or `include:`, followed by a comma-separated list of glyph names. This will apply the filter only to the included glyphs, or the glyphs not excluded, respectively.

### Requirements

The plugin has only been tested for Glyphs 2.4.x on macOS Sierra. It may not work on older configurations.
